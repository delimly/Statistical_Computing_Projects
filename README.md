# StatsCompProjects
Projects that were done during my tenure at the University Of Southampton. 

In this repository you will find R-Projects that demonstrate my profeciency in the R Programming language.
In addition, the focus of these projects (of course) is mainly Statistics with some projects focusing on other areas of mathematics. 

For some, the focus is on Using Monte-Carlo Statistical Methods to producing samples.
